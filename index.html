                <small>Marshall Lee / Fionna</small>
                <p>
                    Good little girl<br>
                    Always picking a fight with me<br>
                    You know that I'm bad<br>
                    But you're spending the night with me<br>
                    What do you want from my world?<br>
                    You're a good little girl<br>
                    Bad little boy<br>
                    That's what you're acting like<br>
                    I really don't buy<br>
                    That you're that kind of guy<br>
                    And if you are<br>
                    Why do you want to hang out with me?<br>
                    Don't you know I'm a villain?<br>
                    Every night I'm out killin'<br>
                    Sendin' everyone runnin' like children<br>
                    I know why you're mad at me<br>
                    I've got demon eyes<br>
                    And they're looking right through your anatomy<br>
                    Into your deepest fears, baby, I'm not from here<br>
                    I'm from the Nightosphere<br>
                    To me, you're clear, transparent<br>
                    You got a thing for me, girl, it's apparent<br>
                    Oh, oh<br>
                    I got a hot potato<br>
                    And I got two hot tomatoes<br>
                    Well, they'll make a good sauce, maybe<br>
                    You're not so bad, you know (so I'll shake it all over the table)<br>
                    Not so bad? (I'll shake it, shake it)<br>
                    I'm the son of a demon (and shake it and shake it)<br>
                    And the Vampire King (and shake it all over the table)<br>
                    It's not something I have to try at<br>
                    You on the other hand (the table, for as long as I am able)<br>
                    I'm not trying to be bad<br>
                    I'm hanging out with you because you're my friend<br>
                    What? Like him?<br>
                    Pfft-pfft, no, different, ugh, hey<br>
                    Hee-ya (oh no)<br>
                    Hee-ya (oh, hahaha)<br>
                    Hey, break it up you two<br>
                </p>
